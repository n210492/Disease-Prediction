Instructions/Process to Run the Ai model:

1.Make sure that the Folder "Ai_Model" contains all the files provided:
   1.clinic.csv
   2.Data.csv
   3.env.csv
   4.exp.py
   5.live.py
   6.test.py

2. Make Sure the following python library modules are installed in your pc to run the Ai model:
    1.pandas
    2.sk-learn
    3.numpy
    4.xgboost
    5.joblib
    6.rapidfuzz
    7.warnings
    8.os
    9.streamlit
    10.datetime
    11.pymongo
    12.time
    13.seaborn
    14.matplotlib

3. Open terminal and type "pip install <lib>" where <lib> refers to the python libraries from the above if they aren't installed.

4.If you have the things mentioned above, Open the exp.py file in any code edior and Run directly or open command prompt and change directory to Present Ai_Model folder and type "python exp.py" to run the file through command prompt.

5.The exp.py will create a Folder named "models" in the same directory if you are running the exp.py file for the first time or if you don't have the "models" folder to train and save the trained models in that "models" folder 

6. If the pickle files generated by exp.py after running and saved in "models" folder, it will run directly the exp.py file and you can give input according to the ai model requests you while run time. This is how you can run and check the Predictions of the ai model according to user inputs.

7.If you want to go through the website , open terminal at same directory and type "python -m streamlit run live.py", it will redirects you to a browser to run the website. in this website you can check the output by giving inputs directly without any python environment.

8.To evaluate the metrics of the ai model, run the test.py in editor or in command prompt directly to check the do the metrics evaluation and to see the plots/graphs of ai model which shows plots of Predictions probability , accuracy, precision, f1-score, etc..
